## How Sync Works

### Offline-First Design
ScriptMine works perfectly offline. All your changes are saved locally and synced when you're online.

### Automatic Sync
When enabled, ScriptMine syncs:
- Every X minutes (configurable)
- When you open the app
- When network becomes available
- After making changes (if online)

### Conflict Resolution
If you edit the same script on multiple devices:
1. ScriptMine detects the conflict
2. Keeps the most recent version
3. Notifies you if manual review is needed
